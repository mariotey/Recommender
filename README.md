# 📚 Recommendation System

## 🧠 Introduction

This project implements two widely used types of recommendation algorithms:

---

## 1. 🤝 Collaborative Filtering

**Collaborative Filtering** recommends items to a user based on the preferences and behaviors of *similar users*. It assumes that if two users liked similar items in the past, they will likely enjoy similar items in the future.

Unlike other methods, collaborative filtering does **not** require item metadata. It relies entirely on the **user-item interaction matrix** (e.g., ratings, likes, clicks).

### ✅ Pros
- Learns user preferences without needing domain knowledge
- Can uncover unexpected or novel items through user behavior patterns

### ⚠️ Cons
- Suffers from the **cold start problem** (new users or items)
- Requires a sufficient amount of user interaction data to be effective

## 2. 🧾 Content-Based Filtering

**Content-Based Filtering** recommends items based on the features of the items themselves and a user’s past preferences. It builds a personalized profile by analyzing what the user liked before (e.g., genres, tags, actors in movies) and recommends items with similar characteristics.

### ✅ Pros
- Works well for users with unique tastes or limited interaction data
- Can recommend new or unpopular items if they match the user’s interests

### ⚠️ Cons
- Tends to recommend items that are too similar to previous ones (lower diversity)
- Requires rich and well-structured metadata for items

## 🔍 Comparison

| Feature                     | Collaborative Filtering             | Content-Based Filtering               |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Based on                   | Similar users' behavior              | Item features + user preferences      |
| Needs item metadata        | ❌ No                                 | ✅ Yes                                 |
| Handles cold start well    | ❌ Poor for new users/items           | ✅ Better for new items                |
| Personalization            | ✅ High                               | ✅ Medium to High                      |
| Novelty in recommendations | ✅ Higher (via peer behavior)         | ❌ Lower (limited to known preferences)|
